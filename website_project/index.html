      <h3>These are just the statistics of the more common illness:</h3>
      <ul></ul>
        <li>
          Anxiety: 3.1% of the population have Generalized Anxiety Disorder. If
          you include all anxiety disorders, including Obsessive Compulsive
          Disorder, Panic Disorder, and others, that number leaps to
          <span class="bold">19.1%</span> of the population.
        </li>
        <li>
          Depression: 3.8% of the population have experienced depression. About
          <span class="bold">20%</span> of those people will be at risk of
          suicide at some point in their lives.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bipolar Disorder: 0.53% of the population have bipolar disorder. Due
          to stigmas regarding the condition messing with access to treatment,
          employment, and education, a person with bipolar will, on average, die
          <span class="bold">10 years earlier</span> than the general population

        As you can see, mental illness affects many people in a very negative
        way. However, a lot of the suffering is caused by stigmas the general
        population has, which are often entirely untrue. For instance:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A person with bipolar disorder isn't just someone who get horribly
          angry and abusive moments. It only means that they have intense mood
          changes, and the mood itself is different per person
        </li>
        <li>
          People with depression are able to feel other emotions besides
          sadness. Depression itself is a dampering of every emotion, and is
          more associated with feelings of hopelessness which lead into sadness
          than sadness itself. However, those other feelings aren't gone,
          they're just rarer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some people think that anxiety is caused by people naturally being
          more worried, and that there's no real way to treat it. Therapy and
          medication combined are very useful in treating anxiety for most
          people, especially in the long term.
        </li>
        <li>
          Generally, there are a lot of people who believe that mental illness
          isn't real, and that all a person needs is a better diet and healthy
          living. While those things may help the symptoms, they won't get at
          the root of the problem.

        While the best treatment options are obviously going to therapy and
        getting treatment from a professional, it's not all hopeless for those
        who can't afford it. Some things a person can do on their own are:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Eating healthy and living healthy are not going to cure you, however
          for many illnesses, they are a great way to help lessen the symptoms
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are feeling depressed, the best thing to do is talk to someone
          you know. It doesn't need to be any specific topic, but it's a great
          way to reassure yourself that you are loved by someone and to distract
          you from your thoughts.

          The 333 method of dealing with an anxiety attack: Look around and
          identify 3 objects, 3 sounds, and then move 3 body parts, in order to
          ground yourself.
